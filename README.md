Simple Mouselooklock addon for people who don't want to keep pressing right mouse click. 
I'M NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE CODE NOR TAKE CREDIT FOR IT. AUTHOR: Mairelon

Just bind a key to activate mouselook in the keybindings menu.
I added a crosshair when Mouselooking is enabled for that first person feels.

I'm a noob at coding don't kill me >.<

Update 05.21 - Crosshair now enlarges and shrinks if the character moves

Megaevilz - I deleted the crosshair file from the main. I don't like it and would like to turn it into a toggle feature. But... Ungabunga faster. Delete.
